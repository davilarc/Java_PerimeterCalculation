## Introduction
This readme provides an overview of the Perimeter Assignment in Java, guiding you through the code structure, explanations, and goals of the assignment. The assignment involves creating a Java program to calculate the perimeter of shapes based on given points.

## Calculating Information about Shapes
The assignment involves completing the PerimeterAssignmentRunner class to calculate various facts about shapes. Several methods are provided, including getPerimeter, testPerimeter, triangle, printFileNames, and main. Your task is to add or modify methods in the PerimeterAssignmentRunner class.

## A Few Ground Rules for Shapes
Shapes are considered collections of points connected by lines. The assignment introduces an example shape with four random points, demonstrating the concept of a shape.

## Explanation of the getPerimeter Method
The getPerimeter method calculates the perimeter of a shape. It loops over all points in the shape, calculating the length of the line formed with the previous point using the distance formula.

## Perimeter Assignment: Part One

### Goals
Complete the getNumPoints method: Returns the number of points in a given shape.
Add code in testPerimeter to call getNumPoints and print the result.
Complete the getAverageLength method: Returns the average length of all sides in a shape.
Add code in testPerimeter to call getAverageLength and print the result.

### Discussion
This section provides detailed instructions on completing the getNumPoints and getAverageLength methods. It explains the logic, syntax, and how to test the program.

## Perimeter Assignment: Part Two

### Goals
Complete the getLargestSide method: Returns the longest side in a given shape.
Add code in testPerimeter to call getLargestSide and print the result.
Complete the getLargestX method: Returns the largest X value among all points in a shape.
Add code in testPerimeter to call getLargestX and print the result.

### Discussion
This section guides you through completing the getLargestSide and getLargestX methods. It explains the logic, syntax, and testing procedures.

## Perimeter Assignment: Part Three

### Goals
Complete the getLargestPerimeterMultipleFiles method: Returns the largest perimeter across multiple shape files.
Finish writing testPerimeterMultipleFiles to call getLargestPerimeterMultipleFiles and print the result.
Finish writing getFileWithLargestPerimeter: Returns the name of the file with the largest perimeter.
Add code to testFileWithLargestPerimeter to call getFileWithLargestPerimeter and print the result.
